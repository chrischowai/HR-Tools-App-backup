# HR Tools Portal - Testing Guide

## üß™ Demo Mode Testing

The portal is currently configured in **demo mode** for immediate testing without requiring Supabase setup.

### Demo Credentials

Use any of these credentials to test the login:

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| `demo`   | `demo123` |
| `admin`  | `admin123` |
| `hr`     | `hr123` |

## üöÄ Quick Test Instructions

### 1. Start Local Server

Choose one of these methods to serve the files:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 3000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

# Node.js (if http-server is installed)
npx http-server -p 3000

# PHP
php -S localhost:3000
```

### 2. Open in Browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the Matrix-style login page.
